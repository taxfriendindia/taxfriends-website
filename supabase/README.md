# TaxFriend India - Supabase Database Setup

This folder contains all SQL scripts needed to set up and maintain your Supabase database.

## 🎯 QUICK START - ONE FILE TO RULE THEM ALL

### **`FINAL-DATABASE-SETUP.sql`** ⭐ **USE THIS ONE**

**This is the ONLY file you need to run!**

**What it does:**
- ✅ Creates all tables (profiles, services, documents, notifications, reviews)
- ✅ Adds ALL missing columns (handled_by, completed_file_url, uploaded_by)
- ✅ Sets up Row Level Security (RLS) policies
- ✅ Creates helper functions (is_admin, is_superuser, get_my_role)
- ✅ Fixes ALL security warnings (15+ functions with search_path)
- ✅ Configures storage buckets and policies
- ✅ Seeds service catalog data
- ✅ Grants all necessary permissions
- ✅ **PRESERVES ALL EXISTING DATA** - Nothing is deleted!

**When to run:**
- ✅ Setting up a new database from scratch
- ✅ Applying all pending migrations to existing database
- ✅ Fixing security warnings
- ✅ Updating schema with new columns

**How to run:**
1. Go to **Supabase Dashboard** → **SQL Editor**
2. Click **"New Query"**
3. Copy and paste the **ENTIRE** `FINAL-DATABASE-SETUP.sql` file
4. Click **"Run"** (or press Ctrl+Enter)
5. Wait for completion message ✅

**Safety:**
- 🔒 **100% Safe** - Uses `IF NOT EXISTS` and `ADD COLUMN IF NOT EXISTS`
- 🔒 **Idempotent** - Can run multiple times without issues
- 🔒 **Data Preserving** - All existing users, services, and documents are kept
- 🔒 **Error Handling** - Built-in exception handling for all operations

## 🔒 Additional Security Setup

After running the SQL script, you need to manually enable one more security feature:

### Enable Leaked Password Protection

1. Go to **Authentication** → **Providers** → **Email**
2. Scroll to **"Password Settings"**
3. Enable **"Check for leaked passwords"**
4. Click **Save**

This will check user passwords against the HaveIBeenPwned database to prevent compromised passwords.

Expected result:
- ✅ 0 Errors

- ✅ All function search_path warnings fixed
